The goal of alcatraz is to enable safe execution of untrusted
code. Unlike sandboxing approaches that restrict file access, alcatraz
allows untrusted code to access the entire file system. This factor
enables most programs to run successfully under alcatraz, as opposed
to experiencing runtime aborts/exceptions due to security violations.

Alcatraz is released under GPL; see the file COPYING for details. 

Alcatraz is a plug-in of etrace, which is available at the download area
of Secure Systems Lab of Stony Brook University
(http://seclab.cs.stonybrook.edu). Before installing alcatraz, the
ETRACEDIR environment variable needs be be set to the directory where
etrace is installed. For example, if the etrace is in /usr/local/bin,
the ETRACEDIR needs to be set to '/usr/local'. Read the INSTALL file
for installation instructions of alcatraz.  

The directory GUI contains the java file of Alcatraz's GUI. A
pre-compiled jar file, alcatrazui.jar, is included in the distribution
for convenience. If you want to rebuild the jar file by yourself, run
the following commands:

    javac *.java
    jar cvf alcatrazui.jar *.class

See the file ChangeLog and NEWS for information on recent changes. 

See the file AUTHORS to see who has contributed to alcatraz. 

The latest version of alcatraz is available in the download area of the
homepage of Secure Systems Lab, Stony Brook University:
