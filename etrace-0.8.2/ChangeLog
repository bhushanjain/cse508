	Move the tracer base and architecture dependent library into a
	shared library, and put it in the 'lib' directory. Both main.cpp
	and extension libraries are linked with this shared library.

	Remove MonitoredProc from the argument list of SysCallArg's 
	constructure. Instead, make it a static member of the class, 
	and initialize it before use. 

	Don't set the MonitoredProc when creating an extension. It is done
	when the extension is inserted into the list of a MonitoredProc.

	MP is not the same across all processes, but the the ArchDep
	object is the same. So move the pid to system call arg repr.

	In PersistArg::unserialize, set the buf_ to 0 if the size is 0,
	otherwise the buf_ will have random value, which will lead to
	segmentation errors.
